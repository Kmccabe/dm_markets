# Adaptive Markets
> Goals

1. To build a microeconomic systems simulation of the evolution of a decentralized market for a homogeneous good to a centralized market.   

2. To port the simulation to mTree to provide a more complex usecase model of mTree.

3. To publish a paper using the simulations to demonstrate the hypothesis described below.

> Hypothesis

Institutional rules may inherit cognitive startegies to reduce the cognitive load of humans in making exchange.  

> Outline of example demonstration.

1. In a network market humans reduce the transacton cost of matching by minimizing social distance as measured by the cost of contracting and fulfillment.  

    * In our simple model these costs are infinite with geographic distance and zero with geographic proximity.  
    
2. During negotiations, proximal agents search for best ultimatum offers from other agents and compete for best ultimatum offers to other agents.  

    * We can think of these offers as posted-offers, and the speed of updating these offers as a measure of competition at a local node in the network.

3. When a node experiences enough two-sided competition an entrepreneur can centralize offers as orders into a limit book and mimic cognivite strategies by imposing an improvement rule on the bid-ask spread defined by the orders.

    * Showing how the continuous double auction (cda) can emerge by inheriting agent's cognitive strategies.

4.  Once a cda emerges agents can adopt budget constrained ZI strategies to minimize their cognitive load.
